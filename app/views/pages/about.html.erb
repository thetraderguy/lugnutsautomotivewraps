			  <h2>Our Story:</h2>
			  
			  
		  	<p>Larry Lugnut founded Lugnutâ€™s Automotive Parts Supply nearly 50 years ago with a passion for customer service being his main focus. Larry built a community of automotive enthusists that felt more like a club than a store. It was because of this that the company has thrived for so long. Larry helped his customers no matter the cost. Because of this, there are several customers that have been with us since the beginning.</p>
			<p>When Larry passed away, he left this vision to one of the people who knew his business better than anyone else - his grandaughter Patty. Patty Lugnut grew up around the shop, and has the same passion for cars and customer service that her grandfather had. Because of this, we like to think that Larry is looking down at all of his family and friends with pride as the shop is still a plave that you see friends gathering to talk about their newest automotive projects.</p>
			<p>Patty, after graduating from The Ohio State University in marketing, has always been one to follow trends and needs of customers. She saw an exciting opportunity in the automotive wraps sector, but realized that there were a lot of missing pieces. The graphic design aspects were often something the customer was left out in the cold with. By having designers on hand, Lugnuts Automotive Wraps has the ability to work with the customer in a very intimate manner, and fulfill any needs that they may have. Patty believes that the most important aspect of the process is customer feedback, and this allows for a satisfied buyer. After all, Patty being a marketing major herself understands the importance that design can play in how people react to your business fleet, or even your personal vehicle.</p>
